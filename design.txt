        1 enter any building in london:
            building guy says: John, what are you doing here? Head to the port quickly. Your father is back.
            I say: He's back? Alright. I'll be there right away. Thank you.


        2 enter port:
            navy guy: You are John, right?
            I: Yes, I am.
            navy guy: I'm the captain of Eagle... You two look so much alike... I'm sorry to inform
                      you that your father, carpenter on board Eagle, died bravely during battle with the Spanish Navy. He was buried at
                      sea. We found this letter in his wardrobe, which must have been written in advance.
                      Here, take it and be strong.
            I: Thank you.

            the letter: Dear John, my son, when you are reading this letter, that means I've gone to the moon to meet your
                        mom.. Poor kid. I will no longer be able to guide you nor protect you. I will no longer kick you in an attempt to
                        get you right. You are on yourself now. I have not been a successful
                        sailor, serving as a carpenter for the majority of my life. Don't be like me.

                        I saved my wage as much as possible so that the figure in my bank account might some day be able to fund
                        a ship. Now, it's yours. Use it wisely.

                        Do you remember Tommy Branson? He's father is an old friend of mine. I believe he'll be interested in joining you.
                        He knows the way in the water as well as any professional navigator. He's working at the bar at Amsterdam.

        3 enter amsterdam bar:
            I: Excuse me, is Tommy Branson working here?
            tommy: Hey, John? How are you? Taking a tour here?
            I: I'm OK. I'm here for you.
            tommy: For me?
            I: Yes. I bought a ship. Do you want to sail with me?
            tommy: You got a ship? Well... Why not? I've done enough bar tending.
